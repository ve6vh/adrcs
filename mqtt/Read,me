This directory contains documentation and library code for the MQTT project.

The documentation has been recently updated to correct some errors, and include samples generated by the library code.

The code generates mqtt payload data as per the specification, using the cJSON library. You can test it by compiling
it as is and including the supplied mainline. This code can be copied if you wish.

The code caters to all three payload types, however in your application if you are space-limited, but setting the
appropriate configuration variable in datatypes.h to the correct value. There are three of them:
#define	USE_AQI				  1			// use AQI frame format
#define	USE_UIFRAME			1			// use a UI frame
#define	USE_TELEM		  	1			// use telemetry

Setting USE_UIFRAME to 0, for example, will exclude that code. Note that the buffer must be long enough to accomodate
the entire message, most seem to fit in 500 bytes or less, with the exception of the telemetry record. There are two
constants that you can use for that purpose.

Have fun.
