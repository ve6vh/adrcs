This directory contains files for using the ARDRCS MQTT broker.

The thingy91 subdirectory contains the downlaodable hex file for the tracking and AQI application for the Nordic Thingy91. See its READ.ME for details.
To view the data, a program called MQTT=Explorer can be installed on a windows machine to monitor data that is uploaded. On linux machines the mosquitto_sub can be used instead.
